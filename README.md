# Messaging Node.js SDK 
`flowroute-messaging-nodejs` is a Node.js SDK that provides methods for interacting with [v2](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/messaging/overview/)  of the Flowroute API. These methods can be used to accomplish the following:

* Send an outbound SMS from a Flowroute phone number
* Retrieve a Message Detail Record (MDR) by searching for a specific message record ID 

**Note:** This SDK does not cover searching for a set of MDRs based on a date range. For searching on a date range, see [Look up a Set of Messages](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/messaging/look-up-set-of-messages/) on the Flowroute Developer Center.

### Documentation 
To work with the SDK, please read and follow the steps in the [Flowroute Node.js Library v2](http://developer.flowroute.com/libraries/v2/nodejs/).
